- 👋 Hi, I’m @Dkbsz. Welcome to my profile!
  I've started learning Python couple months ago and my ambition is to finish PCEP test this year.
  Programming, for me is a key to a change. I'm into many interest and hobbies but back in time I declared to myself, I will focus on one hobby - so I tried programming.
- 👀 I’m interested in finding a perfect way to learn IT stuff. My goal is to learn programming and also gain general experience in IT industry. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning django/selenium/basics of machine learning.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any basic projects. I'd like to participate in co-learning with a buddy.
